# VR-Viewer

This is a project made with Unity3D (https://unity3d.com/) and Google Cardboard API (https://vr.google.com/cardboard/). So you must have Unity version 5.3.5 or later to open the project inside folder "Cardboard Test 2".

1. Open Unity3D and select folder "Cardboard Test 2" when it asks project folder.   
2. Set urls of images in a public List ImageUrls that is on VRManager gameObject. Select VRManager and then increase the Size of ImageUrls and set the nuew url in the empty field.    
3. Run the project (either on Android or on PC).   

* If you are using an Android, place Android phone on Cardboard. When you move the Android&Cardboard you can look at the loaded images. If you press the Cardboard button or the display of your phone, you can view the next image.   
* If you are using PC, press Alt to look around with your mouse movement. Left-click on an image to view the next.   

### My scripts are located at folder **Cardboard Test 2\Assets\VR Viewer**.     

*I hane no rights for the images nor I have created them. You may find assets from Cardboard API inside Project Folders.*
